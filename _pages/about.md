I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computing at the University of Connecticut (UConn), under the supervision of Professor [Dongjin Song](https://songdj.github.io/).

My primary research focus is on machine learning and deep learning, with a current specialization in time series analysis. My additional research interests include:

- Multi-modal time series analysis
- Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series analysis
- Graph representation learning and its application in healthcare and biomedical data

Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and my master's degree from [HUST](http://english.hust.edu.cn/).
